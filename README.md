***Profit Distribution of Ether/Token Through Smart Contract 

  Ethereum 2.0 allows users to stake funds on the blockchain to generate passive income and help the network. The earned rewards are known as annual percentage yields (APYs). Investors who stake on the network will receive a reward. The staking rewards generated on the network will depend upon the amount that the investor has staked and the number of validators on the blockchain.
  
 **The goal of this work
   The goal of the project is to mimic the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract. 
   
   The requirements are pretty simple:
   A.) allow anyone to stack ether and track their balance and
   B.)if a time and stack amount deadline have reached don’t allow users to withdraw their fund (those found are used for a future project, like the Ethereum    PoS).
   
   **Part 1: Implement the stake() method
In this part of the exercise, we want to allow users to stake some ETH in our contract and track their balances.
A.)Payable methods — when a function is declared as payable it means that allows users to send ETH to it.
B.)Mapping — it’s one of the variable types supported by Solidity. It allows you to associate a key with a value.
C.)Events — events allow the contract to notify other entities (contracts, web3 applications, etc) that something has happened. When you declare an event you can specify at max 3 indexed parameters. When a parameter is declared as indexed it allows 3rd-party apps to filter events for that specific parameter.


**Part 2: Deposit Funds on Aave Protocol with token address(WETH)

**Part 3: Withdrawl from Aave and Check Funds

**Part 4: Profit Distribution and create liquidity Pool and swapped some funds amount of any ERC20 token and original funds distribution
